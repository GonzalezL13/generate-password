In this week's password challenge we had to work on our javascript.
The challenge asked us to generate a password. The acceptance criteria wanted us to create a series of prompts to show up once the generate button was clicked.
The first prompt ask for the length of the password they desired.
Then after that each prompt would ask if they wanted lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or special characters included.
If user didn't click okay on any of them, they would get an alert stating that a least one type needed to be chosen in order to create their password.
After prompts were answered, the password was generated.
